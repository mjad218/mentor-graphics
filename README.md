Mentor Graphics Weather Data coding test

## Back End
For the Back End, I am using an express server to manage the API and respose with approbriate data.

to start the back end server, you have to
1. clone the repo on your local machine
2. go to the backend directory
3. run ```npm install```
4. run ```npm start```

### Back end is ready now
the end point ``` https://localhost:4000/location ``` returns the weather data for a specific location

## Front End 
I am gonna use Angular for the front end
